Date: 15 November 2025  


 1. Overview of the component

 I am adding the new component to the Movie Journal API 
 that is a (Search System) that helps users to search movies by title or genre.
 This feature expands the functionality of  API more tahn  CRUD operations and introduces new backend logic that supports flexible movie discovery.

The main motive  of this component is to allows users to easily find
movies based on keywords, making the Movie Journal more user-friendly
and practical for easy use.

 2. Why i choose this component

I selected the search component because:

- It adds meaningful functionality without requiring external APIs.
- It is easy to test and maintain.
